# COIVD Dashboard
This project was built to show a quick visualization of the COVID19 breakout. It gives you a quick look at the breakout globally and then you can break it down by country to get a quick glance of the breakout at a country level. You can see this project deployed on Netlify [here](https://covid19-dashboard-test.netlify.app).

The data is pulled from the NovelCOVID Api. You can see the documentation for it [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/SzS7R6uu?version=latest).
